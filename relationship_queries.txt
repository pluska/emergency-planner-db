# Relationship Queries Examples

# 1. Get a user's profile (one-to-one relationship)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/profiles/user/1

# 2. Get all plans for a user (one-to-many relationship)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/plans/user/1

# 3. Try to create a second profile for a user (should fail)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/profiles \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "user_id": 1,
  "first_name": "Duplicate",
  "last_name": "Profile",
  "phone_number": "+1234567890",
  "address": "123 Test St"
}'

# 4. Get all data for a user (profile and plans)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/profiles/user/1
curl http://localhost:3000/api/plans/user/1

# 5. Example of cascading delete (when user is deleted, their profile and plans are also deleted)
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/users/1

# Verify the cascade delete worked
curl http://localhost:3000/api/profiles/user/1
curl http://localhost:3000/api/plans/user/1
